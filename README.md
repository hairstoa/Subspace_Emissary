# Subspace_Emissary
A text based game to explore, collect, and learn in outer-space. 

This one player game is an outer space exploration survival game. The user takes the role of a spaceship commander leading their team through an unknown portion of space. The goal of the game is to expand our understanding of space by 1) discovering a new inhabitable planet, 2) establish diplomacy with alien species, and 3) find relics to unlock the mysteries of the Universe. Space is vast, there are new planets with potential for life or alien colonies, black holes, andâ€¦ emptiness.  The spaceship has a limited amount of fuel, so your mission must be complete before your tank is empty. Otherwise the game ends.
